[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nevermind78/Octave_Binder/master)

An example of using Octave on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/).

This shows you how to make Matlab code that works with [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) run on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/).

The [example notebook](index.ipynb) is taken from the [TP2](https://github.com/nevermind78/NUM_ANALYSIS/blob/master/TP2/TP2_E.ipynb).
